Learned about [Two's Complement](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/~tomf/notes/cps104/twoscomp.html). Binary conversion from a decimal takes the main number, divides by two, and then logs 1 if there's a remainder for every digit in every generation.

Reverse that, and you get binary.

If you enter in the number `6` and click the `Convert` button, you'll see the following output:

```
Inputs:  [ 6, 3, 1 ]
Quotients:  [ 3, 1, 0 ]
Remainders:  [ 0, 1, 1 ]
```

Notice that the `remainders` array is the binary representation of the number `6`, but in reverse order.

How cosmically beautiful.
