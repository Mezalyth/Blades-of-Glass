I just learned what [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) is. Holy cow. Node Packet Manager, or a Node.js install tool just provides free bits of code. The designer-to-developer pipeline is a common one, and I enjoy how programmers will just *solve problems* and then give away the solutions for free. 

It could be utopian.

[Swiper](https://swiperjs.com/) is a darn cool carousel tool with lots of customization.

### Lessons Learned:
- npm is awesome
- Theres art in development/programming
- [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) is a great front-end cloud stack that includes hosting, DNS, and scaling. Could be a great alternative to AWS.
- Arrow functions for JS is funky
	- const functionName = (parameters) => {};
- I'm not sure that's 100% accurate, but you do condense a LOT.
