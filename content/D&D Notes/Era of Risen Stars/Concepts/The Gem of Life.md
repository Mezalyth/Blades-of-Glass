# The Gem of Life – The First Orb

## Basic Information
- **Name**: The Gem of Life
- **Type**: Artifact from before the time of Risen Stars.
- **Origin**: █ ██████████ ██ ████████.

## Description
- **Physical Appearance**: A spherical object, two meters in diameter. Its surface appears to resemble hammered brass.
- **Powers/Effects**: The gem of life is designed to sustain and create it. Once attuned, it can be called upon to summon water, healing potions, or blood. Infinitely, but at a slow rate. It can also cease generation of those elements if commanded.
- **Limitations**: Three commands from those attuned per day, reset by next dawn.

## Notes
The Gem of Life has become colloquially known as "the orb", a floating sphere that now sits in the [[Sanctuary#Libra Ria]]. An item that was taken from the Fortress of Steel that was once used to sustain and provide life for the [[Steelbacks]]. It is one of six known artifacts that all link to each other magically.

Touching the Gem of Life mentally connects those who touch it with the resident consciousness, RKTR. It also seems to have connected itself to [[GenCon]] via telepathic link.
