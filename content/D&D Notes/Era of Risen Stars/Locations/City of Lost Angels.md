# Location: City of Lost Angels â€“ The Victorian West

## Basic Information
- **Name**: City of Lost Angels
- **Type of Location**: City
- **Region**: South past the Bonelands
- **Affiliation**: Under the influence of the enigmatic Benefactor.

## Description
- **Visual Description**: A city of stark contrasts, from the decaying grandeur of Victorian architecture in the center of the city, to the makeshift resilience of Wild West individualism. The inner city gleams with opulence, while the lower city bears the marks of struggle and survival. While those with influence and power reside on large swaths of property, the more downtrodden folk deal with sparse wooden construction or even tin ramshackle huts. The southern rim is home to a rail station.
- **Atmosphere**: A place of mystery and duality, with the frontier-style buildings and wild west aesthetic blend with the upper echelon.
- **Sounds and Smells**: The central city is filled with the sounds of laughter and music from the House of Generosity, mixed with the subtle fragrance of perfumes and exotic spices. In contrast, the lower city carries the sounds of industry, the clatter of carriage wheels on cobblestones, and the occasional shout, overlaid with the smells of smoke, sweat, and fear. Rich notes of leather and dust permeate the entirety.

## History
- **Founding and Development**: Once a thriving metropolis symbolizing the pinnacle of progress and unity.
- **Notable Events**: Its fracturing into the inner and outer city divisions, marked by the rise of the Benefactor.
- **Legends and Lore**: It is said that the Benefactor's chandelier is a fascinating thing to behold. It is said to be the crown jewel of not only the House of Generosity's ballroom, but the entirety of the city itself. 

## Inhabitants
- **Demographics**: A sharp divide between the affluent residents of the inner city and the hardy souls of the outer city. 
- **Culture and Society**: The inner city is characterized by extravagant displays of wealth and power, while the lower city embodies resilience, adventure, and a certain lawlessness.
- **Leadership and Factions**: Dominated by the unseen Benefactor, whose influence permeates every aspect of city life. This is also the training and recruitment mecca for the Steelbacks. There are also rumors of a rebel group called the Umbra Vulpes.

## Points of Interest

## Economy and Resources

- **Resources**: A mix of technological advancements, spirits and gambling, and people.

## Roleplaying Tips
