# Summary
A derelict gathering of buildings on what was believed to be a dried up river now called The Line. A bastion of civilization created out of necessity, housed in crumbling buildings and worn away structures threaded through with overgrowth and reclamation of nature. 

Glass and steel remnants were used as the foundation of a new place to call home as more and more survivors and refugees landed upon the shores of the Wind Up. 

To the North, the Bonelands. To the south, the wastes. Everywhere beyond: danger. This small township is a diverse mixture of those who ended up here and chose to put down sword, wand, and dagger in favor of working together in peace. At the end of the world, they have each other.

## Points of Interest

### Libra Ria
A large onyx building in the shape of a pyramid with the top sheared off. Here is where all manner of magical artifact and knowledge reside, with a public museum allowing denizens to view and learn about the safer items in the custody of it's caretakers, the Vultures. 

Higher up in the layered rooms and further in beyond the museum are tomes, spells, items of mystery and wonder that are studied, organized, and experimented on. It is said that it used to be a place of great power, now resigned to a holding place of knowledge beyond comprehension.

### The Tortoise and the Hare
A cozy pub, inn, and beloved watering hole ran by a husband and wife couple: Honey the Harengon and Darling the Tortle. Honey handles the bar while Darling takes care of inn responsibilities. 

The interior is paneled with scrap wood, carved lovingly with patterns, and thick rugs and curtains soften the atmosphere. The ale is always cold, and the food and hearth are only outshined by the warmth of the two owners.

### The Returning Ocean
A large body of water with strange currents. Also known as the moving glass, the cerulean horizon has been known to be as treacherous as it is beautiful. Many have tried to make pilgrimage beyond the Wind Up, and have either been lost to the sea, brought back to it's shores, or mysteriously disappeared, with no bird, scry, or message ever having given word of safe or successful journey. 

Storms are frequent in it's skies, and glowing lights have been rumored to be seen in the distance. It is large beyond comprehension, many adventurers have stood upon its shores and gazed out into the brilliant blue, wondering.

### Palace of After
Sanctuary's morgue. A place where the bodies of those fallen in Sanctuary are collected, studied, and cared for. In the desolate times where every resource is precious, even the dead still have something to give.

There's rumors of a creature that can be seen in the rafters high above within the structure.
