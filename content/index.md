`npx quartz sync` 

This is a static site generated by Quartz, using content written in Obsidian.md

A combination of the concepts of a [Digital Garden](https://maggieappleton.com/garden-history) and [Learning Exhaust](https://www.montefischer.com/2020/04/07/some-links.html)/[Learning in Public](https://www.swyx.io/learn-in-public). Good for writing, explaining, meandering, thoughts, etc. in a comfortably unorganized space. A very large series of notes to self but open for others to walk through.

Might maintain, might blow it all up. **Everything is subject to change.**
