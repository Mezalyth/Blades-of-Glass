Figured out how to set a background image, and it turns out that GitHub doesn't serve files or images raw; it instead requires a raw URL.

For example: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Mezalyth/Blades-of-Glass/v4/quartz/static/texture.png

This is an image of a texture I'm wanting to use. It's displaying normally online but it won't render externally. Things served locally don't line up when it's actually live. Haven't figured it out yet, but it's one step further.
